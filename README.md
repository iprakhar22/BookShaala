# BookShaala

BookShaala is a project made as the final project of the subject Database and Web in the second semester. BookShaala is a prototype of an e-commerce website which enables one to to buy, sell and rent engineering course books online.


To create and populate the MySQL tables, execute the MySQL commands provided in my MySQL dump named 'bookshaala.sql' or simply import the dump with the help of a software like phpMyAdmin. The database is named 'bookshaala'. To change the MySQL username and password edit the BookShaala/php/ files.
