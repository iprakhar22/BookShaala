        This about us page is actually an about ME page.

			  This whole project, along with the websites (frontend, backend and database) was made wholly by Prakhar Vaish (16803025). I am an enthusiastic techie who loves coding stuff. This project was made by me as the final project for the subject DB&W in my college.<br><br>

        This is a website for buying/selling/renting books (as if the title page doesn't say so already). It is still not finished 100% but I think this does serve the purpose of showing the functionality of all the things I could add to this website in the timespan of 5 days. Yes, I, like every other engineer, procrastinated and left this project to be made in the very last time. That's what you call living on the edge, right?<br><br>

        Also, this is my first time using bootstrap and this is my first big website project.
